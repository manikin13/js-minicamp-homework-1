Feynman writing Prompts
Variables: A variable is a place holder that is assigned a value. This place holder is an easier way to call that value later in
the program, and / or changed.

Strings: A string is a non-numeric value. It has length but cannot be used nemerically without conversion to a number.

Functions: A function is a code snippet that runs when called. It can take values in, and return an answer based on what the code
snippet is supposed to do. ie take in 2 numbers (arguments), and return the sum of the two (answer)

If statements: When a multiple choice of solutions is possible for an input, an If statement checks to see which solution matches the
input best, and executes the response based on the match. If no match is found the last case - no match response is returned.

Boolean Values: If a response or input can be one of two possabilities it is considered a boolean value. They can be True/False, 0/1,
Open/Close, Yes/No. Ie there are 10 types of people in the world, Those who understand Binary ..., There are 2 types of people in the
world, those who can extrapolate from incomlete data.
